# 16.2 Which Segment Are We Referring To?

possible typo:
SEG_MASK would be set to 0x3000

correction:
SEG_MASK would be set to 0x1000

explanation:

* The book sets up SEG_MASK to be 0x3000 ( 3*16^3 == 12288 )
* The section is presumably referring to the same heap as in section 16.1
* The heap starts at virtual address 4KB, 0x1000 ( 1*16^3 == 4096 )
* Presumably this is the SEG_MASK we want to use?
